## Database System 

![Database](wireframe/database.jpg)

## System Design

The system of User and Admin Web is designed following the MVC Pattern.
- The MVC2 (Model-View-Controller 2) pattern is a software architecture based on the MVC model and is commonly used in web applications using JavaServer Pages (JSP) or similar technologies. It consists of three main components:

Model: Represents the data and business logic of the application, often implemented as a Plain Old Java Object (POJO) or related to database access.

View: Represents the user interface (UI) of the application, displaying data from the model and interacting with users through JSP or HTML.

Controller: Handles user requests, coordinates the flow of the application. It is usually implemented as a servlet or Java class, which calls the model and selects the appropriate view to respond to users.

- We developed the project with 2 separate websites. Every website applies the MVC model.

This small exercise contributed to my overall development, and I appreciate the support of my teammates and teachers.

- Ngoc Tuan: The project exceeded my expectations. I gained valuable experiences in time management, teamwork, problem-solving, and a sense of responsibility at work. I am proud of working with my teammate, and although the website may not meet all market demands, it is a meaningful achievement for both of us. I am thankful for this group exercise and the support of my teammate throughout the project.

**Future app improvements:**

- Code reorganization and cleaning.
- Addition of advanced functions like suggestions, favorites, picture tracking, electronic payments, etc.
